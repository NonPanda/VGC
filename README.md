# VGC (Video Game Compendium)

This project was made purely using MERN stack and the primary reason for making it was to use TailwindCSS in a project for the first time. Currently has 6 classic games and each player's scores are saved concurrently.

# To Do:
Implement a payment gateway (games will still be free)
Some mobile controls(?)

# Demo
